# thisAble - Mobilising the Specially-abled

Kindness is the language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see, but in todayâ€™s rapidly growing world full of rush and chaos, no one bothers about anyone except themselves. The research on blind navigation system, conducted in 2007 stated that 49% of the visually impaired think that finding their way is the main difficulty in their trip, and 40% think that taking a bus is a herculean task. According to Indian Tourist Statistics 2015, the Number of Foreign Tourist arrivals in India is approximately 8.3 million while the CAGR is 4.5%. The year 2015 witnessed a growth of 11.63% in domestic tourist visits over 2014. According to the Census data of 2001, In-migrants count of Tamil Nadu was 270,473 from other sates. A majority of the tourists and migrants are not polyglots. Hence, the different languages spoken across India build up a communication gap for them, and they tend to face lots of problems, especially in navigation. Our project, thisAble aims to develop a bus detection system using RFID for the visually impaired, tourists and migrants and will be a revolutionary approach in overcoming such issues and will empower our target users thus making them self-reliant.
